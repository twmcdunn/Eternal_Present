 * This has a very similar function to BytesBuffer.
 * It shares many of its methods, though it misses some,
 * and adds some more.
 * The general idea of it is,
 * to have a buffer that is just filled sequentially over time,
 * with the ability to replace specific parts of the internal buffer later on,
 * but only when the original put and the overwriting put
 * receive data of the same length.
 * This is a quite common scenario.
 * This interface alone has no advantage over {@link ByteBuffer},
 * but it allows for alternate implementations of it,
 * which have performance benefits in certain scenarios.
